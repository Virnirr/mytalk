Special Instruction:
usage: mytalk [ -v ] [ -a ] [ -N ] [ hostname ] port

    -v : increases verbosity and gives more info
    -a : (server) accept a connection without asking
    -N : do not start ncurses windowing (useful while debugging)

mytalk is a program that allows one user on a machine to send and receive any messages from another user on a separate machine in the same network. It will split the screen into two parts, one is the remote user's (host or server) and another machine (client). It will display the remote user's on the top half of the screen while displaying the client's machine on the bottom half of the machine. The connection between the two receiving and sending end is managed by a talk daemon, which is a process existing in the background which waits for another network's connection, then ask the target if they want to proceed.
